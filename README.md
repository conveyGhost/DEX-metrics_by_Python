# Dex Metrics Repo

This repo is for managing queries and discussions around the [Dune DEX Metrics](https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics) dashboard.

>*This repo was created [using this template](https://github.com/duneanalytics/DuneQueryRepo), made to [manage your Dune queries](https://dune.mintlify.app/api-reference/crud/endpoint/create) and any [CSVs as Dune tables](https://dune.mintlify.app/api-reference/upload/endpoint/upload).*

### For Contributors

I've set up four types of issues right now:
- `bugs`: This is for data quality issues like miscalculations or broken queries.
- `chart improvements`: This is for suggesting improvements to the visualizations.
- `query improvements`: This is for suggesting improvements to the query itself, such as adding an extra column or table that enhances the results.
- `generic questions`: This is a catch all for other questions or suggestions you may have about the dashboard.

If you want to contribute, either start an issue or go directly into making a PR (using the same labels as above). Once the PR is merged, the queries will get updated in the frontend.

### Query Management Scripts

You'll need python and pip installed to run the script commands. If you don't have a package manager set up, then use either [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) . Then install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
